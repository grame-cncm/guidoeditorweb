(*
	Introduced in version 1.7.0

	The engine supports variables that must be declared in a section that precedes the score start.
	These variables may be next used in place of tag parameters or in place of any arbitrary gmn code.
	They may be viewed as macros and are expanded inline by the parser.

	known issues: 
	- variables at the end of a range must be followed by a space (preceding the closing ')')
	- variables used as note name followed by note attributes must be followed by a space
