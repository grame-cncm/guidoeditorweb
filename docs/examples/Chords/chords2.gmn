(* Chord-Sample
   In Release 0.3 a very simple 
   collosision detection has been
   implemented when using chords.
   The following demonstrates, how
   notes are shifted so that they do
   not collide.
   Please note, that accidentals are
   not yet treated (but will be in
   future versions) *)

[ { c/2, f,g,a } { d/1, f, g } ]
